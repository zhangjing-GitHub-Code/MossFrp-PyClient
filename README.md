# MossFrp-PyClient
A client for MossFrp by Python(with my low python tech()), planned at least in CLI

## config and frpc root dir:
- On windows: `./data` (data/ in current dir)
- On linux & MacOS: `~/.config/mossfrp-pyc`
~I may make Mac and linux differ later~
Now only can download frp, login MossFrp and no any ui provided.
